            <h5> Responsive Web Design </h5>
            <h6>  Today's Internet users hear the acronym HTML and (maybe)
              understand it plays some role in the web pages they view and use.
              Though they understand HTML is a piece of their web experience,
              they are unfamiliar with how its fundamental role in modern web
              design is outdated and even somewhat unrelated to their experience
               today. Originally, HTML was designed for document exchange,
                management, and publishing. As the Internet has expanded, it's
                role in users' lives, culture, and society at large has evolved
                past document-sharing – though we do use the Internet for a
                significant amount of written content. In response to early
                changes, we developed Cascading Style Sheets – CSS – to alter
                the way pages look. Web Design  is a specialization and direct
                result of this change in technology and adoption. Along with it,
                 we developed language and ideas around best practices for users,
                developers, and designers.

                Following this major shift, the devices and software we use to
                discover content, interact with resources, and experience web pages
                have also dramatically evolved. As the ways we access and
                 experience content have changed, so have the technical needs for
                  and conceptual understanding of functional web design. Websites
                  today exist and are accessed on  different types of browsers,
                  devices, and screen sizes. The field of Responsive Web Design
                  has developed in response to the changing needs of both technology
                  and users. Its premise is to design all web content around
                  accessibility for a diverse range of devices, browsers, and
                  users. It aims to overcome the constraints of designing for just
                  one setting by creating templates that are flexible. By designing
                  for different types of content – videos, images, and text – as
                  well as different technology, web content can be richly experienced
                  no matter the environment.
